# Docker Commands

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Here are some common Docker commands organized into sections.

---

### Building Images

**Build a Docker image with a specified tag:**

```bash
$ docker build -t kiada:latest .
```

This command builds a Docker image named "kiada" with the "latest" tag using the current directory as the build context.

**List Docker images:**

```bash
$ docker images
```

This command lists all Docker images available on your system.

**Display the history of a Docker image:**

```bash
$ docker history kiada:latest
```

This command shows the history of the "kiada:latest" Docker image, including its layers and commands used in each layer.

---

### Running Containers

**Run a Docker container with a specific command:**

```bash
$ docker run busybox echo "Hello World"
```

This command runs a Docker container using the "busybox" image and executes the "echo" command within the container.

**Run a Redis container with the Alpine base image:**

```bash
$ docker run redis:alpine
```

This command starts a Redis container using the "redis:alpine" image.

**Run a Redis container with a specific version:**

```bash
$ docker run redis:5.0.7-alpine
```

This command runs a Redis container with the specified version using the "redis:5.0.7-alpine" image.

**Run a Docker container with port mapping and in detached mode:**

```bash
$ docker run --name kiada-container -p 1234:8080 -d kiada
```

Here, a Docker container named "kiada-container" is created, and port 1234 on the host is mapped to port 8080 in the container. The container runs in detached mode.

---

### Managing Containers

**List running Docker containers:**

```bash
$ docker ps
```

This command displays a list of running Docker containers along with their details.

**Inspect a Docker container:**

```bash
$ docker inspect kiada-container
```

This command provides detailed information about the "kiada-container" Docker container, including configuration and network settings.

**View logs of a Docker container:**

```bash
$ docker logs kiada-container
```

This command displays the logs generated by the "kiada-container" Docker container.

**Stop a running Docker container:**

```bash
$ docker stop kiada-container
```

This command stops the "kiada-container" Docker container.

**Remove a Docker container:**

```bash
$ docker rm kiada-container
```

This command removes the "kiada-container" Docker container.

---

### Image Management

**Tag a Docker image with a new name and version:**

```bash
$ docker tag kiada luksa/kiada:0.1
```

This command tags the "kiada" image as "luksa/kiada:0.1," allowing you to version your Docker images.

**Login to a Docker registry:**

```bash
$ docker login -u yourid docker.io
```

This command logs you into the Docker registry using your Docker ID, enabling you to push images to the registry.

**Push a Docker image to a registry:**

```bash
$ docker push yourid/kiada:0.1
```

This command pushes the "yourid/kiada:0.1" Docker image to the Docker registry.

---

### Running Containers from Images

**Run a Docker container from a tagged image:**

```bash
$ docker run --name kiada-container -p 1234:8080 -d luksa/kiada:0.1
```

This command runs a Docker container from the "luksa/kiada:0.1" image with port mapping and in detached mode.

---

### Removing Images

**Remove a Docker image:**

```bash
$ docker rmi kiada:latest
```

This command removes the "kiada:latest" Docker image from your system.

---

### Advanced Container Operations

**Execute a command in a running Docker container:**

```bash
$ docker exec -it kiada-container bash
```

This command allows you to open an interactive shell (bash) in the running "kiada-container" Docker container.

**View processes within a Docker container:**

```bash
$ ps aux | grep app.js
```

This command lists processes running within a Docker container. In this example, it searches for processes related to "app.js."

---

### Resource Constraints

**Run a Docker container with specific CPU cores:**

```bash
$ docker run --cpuset-cpus="1,2" ...
```

This command restricts a container to run on specific CPU cores.

**Run a Docker container with a specific CPU share (percentage):**

```bash
$ docker run --cpus="0.5" ...
```

This command limits a container to use only 50% of the available CPU resources.

**Run a Docker container with a specific memory limit:**

```bash
$ docker run --memory="100m" ...
```

This command restricts a container's memory usage to 100 megabytes.

**Run a privileged Docker container with host namespaces:**

```bash
$ docker run --net=host --ipc=host --uts=host --pid=host --privileged ...
```

This command runs a Docker container with host-level network, IPC, UTS, and PID namespaces, providing privileged access to the host system.
